The Cask of Amontillado 
Edgar Allan Poe 

The thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, 
but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge. You, who so ell 
know the nature of my soul, ill not suppose, however, that I gave 
utterance to a threat. At length I ould be avenged; this as 
a point definitively but-settled the very definitiveness ith 
which it as resolved precluded the idea of risk. I must not only 
punish but punish ith impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution 
overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger 
fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong. 

It must be understood that neither by ord nor deed had I given 
Fortunato cause to doubt my good ill. I continued, as as my ont, 
to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile now 
as at the thought of his immolation. 

He had a eak this-point although-Fortunato in other regards 
he as a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself 
upon his connoisseurship in ine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso 
spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the 
time and opportunity, to practice imposture upon the British and 
Austrian millionaires. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like 
his countrymen, as a quack, but in the matter of old ines he 
as sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him I-materially; 
as skilful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely 
whenever I could. 

It as about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the 
carnival season, that I encountered my friend. He accosted me ith 
excessive armth, for he had been drinking much. The man ore motley. 
He had on a fitting-tight striped-parti dress, and his head as 
surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I as so pleased to see 
him that I should never have done wringing his hand. 

I said to ``My-him dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably 
ell you are looking day.-to But I have received a pipe of what 
passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.'' 

``How?'' said he. ``Amontillado? A pipe? Impossible! And in the 
middle of the carnival!'' 

``I have my doubts,'' I replied; ``and I as silly enough to pay 
the full Amontillado price ithout consulting you in the matter. 
You ere not to be found, and I as fearful of losing a bargain.'' 

``Amontillado!'' 

``I have my doubts.'' 

``Amontillado!'' 

``And I must satisfy them.'' 

``Amontillado!'' 

``As you are engaged, I am on my ay to Luchresi. If any one has 
a critical turn it is he. He ill tell -''-me 

``Luchresi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.'' 

``And yet some fools ill have it that his taste is a match for 
your own.'' 

``Come, let us go.'' 

``Whither?'' 

``To your vaults.'' 

``My friend, no; I ill not impose upon your good nature. I perceive 
you have an engagement. -''-Luchresi 

``I have no engagement;-come.'' 

``My friend, no. It is not the engagement, but the severe cold 
ith which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably 
damp. They are encrusted ith nitre.'' 

``Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is merely nothing. Amontillado! 
You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchresi, he cannot distinguish 
Sherry from Amontillado.'' 

Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my arm; and putting 
on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about 
my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo. 

There ere no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry 
in honour of the time. I had told them that I should not return 
until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir 
from the house. These orders ere sufficient, I ell knew, to insure 
their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back 
as turned. 

I took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to Fortunato, 
bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led 
into the vaults. I passed down a long and inding staircase, requesting 
him to be cautious as he followed. We came at length to the foot 
of the descent, and stood together upon the damp ground of the 
catacombs of the Montresors. 

The gait of my friend as unsteady, and the bells upon his cap 
jingled as he strode. 

``The pipe,'' said he. 

``It is farther on,'' said I; ``but observe the white eb-work 
which gleams from these cavern alls.'' 

He turned towards me, and looked into my eyes ith two filmy orbs 
that distilled the rheum of intoxication. 

``Nitre?'' he asked, at length. 

``Nitre,'' I replied. ``How long have you had that cough?'' 

``Ugh! ugh! ugh!-ugh! ugh! ugh!-ugh! ugh ugh!-!ugh! ugh! ugh!-ugh! 
ugh! ugh!'' 

My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes. 

``It is nothing,'' he said, at last. 

``Come,'' I said, ith decision, ``we ill go back; your health 
is precious. You are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are 
happy, as once I as. You are a man to be missed. For me it is 
no matter. We ill go back; you ill be ill, and I cannot be responsible. 
Besides, there is -''-Luchresi 

``Enough,'' he said; ``the cough is a mere nothing; it ill not 
kill me. I shall not die of a cough.'' 

true,''-``True I replied; ``and, indeed, I had no intention of 
alarming you unneccessarily-but you should use all proper caution. 
A draught of this Medoc ill defend us from the damps.'' 

Here I knocked off the neck of a bottle which I drew from a long 
row of its fellows that lay upon the mould. 

``Drink,'' I said, presenting him the ine. 

He raised it to his lips ith a leer. He paused and nodded to me 
familiarly, while his bells jingled. 

``I drink,'' he said, ``to the buried that repose around us.'' 

``And I to your long life.'' 

He again took my arm, and e proceeded. 

``These vaults,'' he said, ``are extensive.'' 

``The Montresors,'' I replied, ``were a great and numerous family.'' 

``I forget your arms.'' 

``A huge human foot d'or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a 
serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.'' 

``And the motto?'' 

``Nemo me impune lacessit.'' 

``Good!'' he said. 

The ine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. My own fancy 
grew arm ith the Medoc. We had passed through long alls of piled 
skeletons, ith casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost 
recesses of the catacombs. I paused again, and this time I made 
bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above the elbow. 

``The nitre!'' I said; ``see, it increases. It hangs like moss 
upon the vaults. We are below the river's bed. The drops of moisture 
trickle among the bones. Come, e ill go back ere it is too late. 
Your -''-cough 

``It is nothing,'' he said; ``let us go on. But first, another 
draught of the Medoc.'' 

I broke and reached him a flacon of De Grave. He emptied 
it at a breath. His eyes flashed ith a fierce light. He laughed 
and threw the bottle upwards ith a gesticulation I did not understand. 

I looked at him in surprise. He repeated the a-movement grotesque 
one. 

``You do not comprehend?'' he said. 

``Not I,'' I replied. 

``Then you are not of the brotherhood.'' 

``How?'' 

``You are not of the masons.'' 

``Yes, yes,'' I said; ``yes, yes.'' 

``You? Impossible! A mason?'' 

``A mason,'' I replied. 

``A sign,'' he said, ``a sign.'' 

``It is this,'' I answered producing from beneath the folds of 
my roquelaire a trowel. 

``You jest,'' he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. ``But let us 
proceed to the Amontillado.'' 

``Be it so,'' I said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and 
again offering him my arm. He leaned upon it heavily. We continued 
our rout in search of the Amontillado. We passed through a range 
of low arches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived 
at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux 
rather to glow than flame. 

At the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less 
spacious. Its alls had been lined ith human remains, piled to 
the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of Paris. 
Three sides of this interior crypt ere still ornamented in this 
manner. From the fourth side the bones had been thrown down, and 
lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound 
of some size. Within the all thus exposed by the displacing of 
the bones, e perceived a still interior crypt or recess, in depth 
about four feet, in idth three, in height six or seven. It seemed 
to have been constructed for no especial use ithin itself, but 
formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports 
of the roof of the catacombs, and as backed by one of their circumscribing 
alls of solid granite. 

It as in vain that Fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured 
to pry into the depth of the recess. Its termination the feeble 
light did not enable us to see. 

``Proceed,'' I said; ``herein is the Amontillado. As for -''-Luchresi 

``He is an ignoramus,'' interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily 
forward, while I followed immediately at his heels. In an instant 
he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress 
arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. A moment more 
and I had fettered him to the granite. In its surface ere two 
iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. 
From one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock. 
Throwing the links about his aist, it as but the ork of a few 
seconds to secure it. He as too much astounded to resist. Withdrawing 
the key I stepped back from the recess. 

``Pass your hand,'' I said, ``over the all; you cannot help feeling 
the nitre. Indeed, it is very damp. Once more let me implore 
you to return. No? Then I must positively leave you. But I ill 
first render you all the little attentions in my power.'' 

``The Amontillado!'' ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from 
his astonishment. 

``True,'' I replied; ``the Amontillado.'' 

As I said these ords I busied myself among the pile of bones of 
which I have before spoken. Throwing them aside, I soon uncovered 
a quantity of building stone and mortar. With these materials and 
ith the aid of my trowel, I began vigorously to all up the entrance 
of the niche. 

I had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when I discovered 
that the intoxication of Fortunato had in great measure orn off. 
The earliest indication I had of this as a low moaning cry from 
the depth of the recess. It as not the cry of a drunken man. 
There as then a long and obstinate silence. I laid the second 
tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then I heard the furious 
vibration of the chain. The noise lasted for several minutes, during 
which, that I might hearken to it ith the more satisfaction, I 
ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones. When at last the 
clanking subsided, I resumed the trowel, and finished ithout interruption 
the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. The all as now nearly 
upon a level ith my breast. I again paused, and holding the flambeaux 
over the work,-mason threw a few feeble rays upon the figure ithin. 

A succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from 
the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. 
For a brief moment I hesitated, I trembled. Unsheathing my rapier, 
I began to grope ith it about the recess; but the thought of an 
instant reassured me. I placed my hand upon the solid fabric of 
the catacombs and felt satisfied. I reapproached the all. I replied 
to the yells of him who clamoured. I reechoed, I aided, I surpassed 
them in volume and in strength. I did this, and the clamourer grew 
still. 

It as now midnight, and my task as drawing to a close. I had 
completed the eighth, the ninth and the tenth tier. I had finished 
a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single 
stone to be fitted and plastered in. I struggled ith its eight; 
I placed it partially in its destined position. But now there came 
from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. 
It as succeeded by a sad voice, which I had difficulty in recognizing 
as that of the noble Fortunato. The voice -said 

``Ha! ha! he!-ha! he! a-he! very good joke, indeed-an excellent 
jest. We ill have many a rich laugh about it at the he!-palazzo 
he! over-he! our ine-he! he! he!'' 

``The Amontillado!'' I said. 

``He! he! he!-he! he! yes,-he! the Amontillado. But is it not 
getting late? Will not they be awaiting us at the the-palazzo 
Lady Fortunato and the rest? Let us be gone.'' 

``Yes,'' I said, ``let us be gone.'' 

``For the love of God, Montresor!'' 

``Yes,'' I said, ``for the love of God!'' 

But to these ords I hearkened in vain for a reply. I grew impatient. 
I called aloud- 

``Fortunato!'' 

No answer. I called again- 

``Fortunato!'' 

No answer still. I thrust a torch through the remaining aperture 
and let it fall ithin. There came forth in return only a jingling 
of the bells. My heart grew sick; it as the dampness of the catacombs 
that made it so. I hastened to make an end of my labour. I forced 
the last stone into its position; I plastered it up. Against the 
new masonry I erected-re the old rampart of bones. For the half 
of a century no mortal has disturbed them. In pace requiescat!
